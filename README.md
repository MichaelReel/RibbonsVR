# RibbonsVR
Attempt to create a VR 'drawing' application

Plan is to create a tool that allows the VR user to 'draw' ribbons of triangles in the air.

Trigger to draw, stick to change the ribbon size and definition.
No movement outside the play area (teleport) initially, but maybe later.

Longer term: Provide some way to store/export creations for review/edit in blender.
